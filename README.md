# Devlog Entry - 11/14/25
## Introducing the team

Either organizing by person or by role, tell us who will do what on your team. Your team should span at least the following four roles:

    Tools Lead: This person will research alternative tools, identify good ones, and help every other team member set them up on their own machine in the best configuration for your project. This person might also establish your team’s coding style guidelines and help peers setup auto-formatting systems. This person should provide support for systems like source control and automated deployment (if appropriate to your team’s approach).
    Engine Lead: This person will research alternative engines, get buy-in from teammates on the choice, and teach peers how to use it if it is new to them. This might involve making small code examples outside of the main game project to teach others. The Engine Lead should also establish standards for which kinds of code should be organized into which folders of the project. They should try to propose software designs that insulate the rest of the team from many details of the underlying engine.
    Design Lead: This person will be responsible for setting the creative direction of the project, and establishing the look and feel of the game. They might make small art or code samples for others to help them contribute and maintain game content. Where the project might involve a domain-specific language, the Design Lead (who is still an engineer in this class) will lead the discussion as to what primitive elements the language needs to provide.
    Testing Lead:  This person will be responsible for both any automated testing that happens within the codebase as well as organizing and reporting on human playtests beyond the team.

If your team has fewer than four people, some people will need to be the lead for multiple disciplines, but no person should be the lead for more than two disciplines.

If your team has more than four people, you are welcome to sub-divide the roles above into more specific roles or tag people as Assistant or Backup for one of the existing roles. Alternatively, you could invent new lead roles if your team is going to try a special game design technique (e.g. assign a Procgen Lead if your team is planning to use procedural generation).

Overall, the four main disciplines all need to be associated with the name of specific people on your team.
## Tools and materials

With about one paragraph each (ideally including clickable hyperlinks

Links to an external site.)...

    Engine: Tell us about what engines, libraries, frameworks, and or platforms you intend to use, and give us a tiny bit of detail about why your team chose those. You are not committing to use this engine to finish the project, just sharing your initial thinking on engine choice. IMPORTANT: In order to satisfy the F1 Requirements, you'll need to choose something that doesn't already support high-level 3D rendering and physics (it must be something that requires you to bring those features in for yourself). If you don't know what to use, "the baseline web browser platform" is a good default choice.
    Language: Tell us programming languages (e.g. TypeScript) and data languages (e.g. JSON) you team expects to use and why you chose them. Presumably you’ll just be using the languages expected by your previously chosen engine/platform.
    Tools: Tell us about which tools you expect to use in the process of authoring your project. You might name the IDE for writing code, the image editor for creating visual assets, or the 3D editor you will use for building your scene. Again, briefly tell us why you made these choices. Maybe one of your teammates feels especially skilled in that tool or it represents something you all want to learn about.
    Generative AI: Tell us about your team's plan for using (or not using) tools based on generative AI, whether they are agentic or not. For example, will you be requiring team members to use or not use specific features of specific tools? Perhaps you plan use the autocomplete features in Github Copilot but not the agent mode. Maybe you will only use the agent mode under specific instructions for it to not make any direct modifications to your code, only giving the developer advice on how to proceed.

## Outlook

Give us a short section on your outlook on the project. You might cover one or more of these topics:

    What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?
    What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?
    What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?
